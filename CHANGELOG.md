# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Metadata Translation Control** - Added `translateMetadata` configuration option (default: `false`)
  - Allows control over whether metadata is translated along with UI strings
  - For example, in Flutter ARB files, metadata entries like `@key` contain descriptions that can optionally be translated
  - When disabled (default), metadata remains unchanged in target files, ensuring consistency
  - Available in CLI via `--translate-metadata` flag and programmatic API via `translateMetadata` config option

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- **JSONC Support** - Added support for `.jsonc` (JSON with Comments) file extension for translation
  - Works with both CLI and programmatic API
  - Auto-detects `.jsonc` files in project structure alongside `.json` files
- **Shopify Theme Localization** - Added support for Shopify theme localization file patterns:
  - Automatically detects and handles files with `.default.` in the name (e.g., `en.default.schema.json`)
  - Removes `.default.` from target file names while preserving language code
  - Preserves `.schema.` suffix in translated files when present in source file
  - Example: `locales/en.default.schema.json` → `locales/es-ES.schema.json`, `locales/fr.schema.json`

### Changed
- Enhanced project structure detection to recognize both `.json` and `.jsonc` files
- Improved language code extraction to handle Shopify theme naming patterns

## [1.1.4] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **CLI** - Fixed `--version` command to read version dynamically from package.json instead of hardcoded value
  - Previously always returned "1.0.0" regardless of actual package version
  - Now correctly returns the installed package version (e.g., "1.1.4")

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **GitHub Action** - Composite action for automated translation in CI/CD workflows
  - Automatic translation on push/PR with customizable triggers
  - Pull request or direct commit modes
  - Configurable
  - Optional Node.js setup for workflows that already have Node installed
  - Built-in GitHub CLI for PR creation (no external dependencies)
- Example workflows for GitHub Actions integration
- Comprehensive release documentation (`RELEASE.md`)

### Fixed
- **CLI Batch Command** - Strip UTF-8 BOM from config files (fixes PowerShell `Out-File` issues)
- **CLI Batch Command** - Improved JSON parsing error messages with file preview
- **GitHub Action** - Fixed API key handling to support both input and environment variable

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-15

- Simplified package structure - main package focuses on CLI tool
- README updated with SDK package reference

### Fixed
- Improved monorepo structure for better package separation

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

  - Enhanced error messages with actionable links to get API keys
  - Better handling of insufficient balance scenarios
